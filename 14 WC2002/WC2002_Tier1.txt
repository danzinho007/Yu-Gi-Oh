Description:
------------
Most likely the first opponent you will choose to face is the hero of the Yu-
Gi-Oh! saga, Yugi Muto.  While not as talented as he is in the anime/manga, his
deck posesses the rare Dark Magician and Buster Blader, as well as a full set
of Exodia.  However, his deck lacks focus and a full supporting cast of
Magic/Trap cards.  He makes an excellent beginning opponent to learn the game
with before you go on to harder duelists.

Traps:
------
None, which is unique for any character in the game

Description:
------------
In the anime, her deck centered around cutesie monsters with cutesie Equips.
She has ditched the Equips in this game, and instead put in a few powerhouse
Magics, and a couple of piledriver monsters (Gemini Elf, Cyber-Tech Alligator).
Overall, she is lacking in power, so I would get rid of her quickly before she
brings out her heavy hitters.  Slightly more difficult than Yugi, but still
very beatable.

1x Polymerization
1x Pot of Greed
1x Raigeki
1x Sword of Dragon's Soul

Traps:
------
1x Magic Jammer
1x Magic-Arm Shield
1x Mirror Force
1x Skull Dice

Fusion:
-------
I believe he uses B. Skull Dragon and Thousand Dragon, and possibly Alligator's
Sword Dragon, but I have not seen him pull any Fusions on me, so I can't be
sure.

Description:
------------
He is definitely a step up from Yugi and Tea here, because he is packing some
power monsters (like the Red-Eyes B. Dragon and Summoned Skull), as well as
powerful Magic and Trap cards.  The opponents you face in the future will have
similar cards, so this will be a good test to see if you can hang with the big
boys or not.

------

1x Dark-Piercing Light
1x Goblin's Secret Remedy
1x Legendary Sword
1x Monster Reborn
1x Mooyan Curry
1x Soul of the Pure
1x Sword of Dark Destruction

Traps:
------

1x Gryphon Wing
1x Seven Tools of the Bandit

Description:
------------
Tristan is definitely a step down from Joey, around the same level as Yugi and
Tea.  Most of his monsters are weak and vulnerable.  He does run some 2000
defense monsters, which may give you trouble, but overall, this is an easy win.

Traps:
------

1x Magic Jammer
1x Spellbinding Circle
1x Trap Hole

Description:
------------
Because Konami can't translate worth anything, they used the Japanese format of
writing names for a couple of names.  This is an example.  His name in English
would be Ryou Bakura, but it's kind of a moot point, because everyone refers to
him as "Bakura", similarly to how Joey is referred to by his last name
"Jounouchi" in the Japanese version.

Bakura runs a Zombie deck.  Plain and simple.  Zombie decks are based around
the Castle of Dark Illusions and Pumpking the King of Ghosts to pump their
power up.  Bakura is also the first duelist to use a Ritual monster
(Dokurorider), but what I would be careful for is his 3 Dark Elfs.  2000 attack
power for a Level 4 will destroy the vast majority of monsters in this game.
Try to get him down low in LP so he won't be able to pay the 1000 LP to attack
with them.
