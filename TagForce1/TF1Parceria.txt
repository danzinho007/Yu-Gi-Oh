3. Character Locations and How to Be Their Partners
###############################################################################

[1st Note: You have to clear the game at least once to be able to choose any of
the Page 2 and 3 characters as a partner.]

[2nd Note: For the Page 1 characters, in order to increase their hearts, give 
them each their favorite sandwiches. You can find that information in the 
forums, as well as from their character bios. The Golden Egg sandwich will fill
up one heart automatically. Also, have Pharaoh the Cat follow behind you 
because no matter what topic you choose, you will always end up with a Great
Talk (choose any selection from #1 to #3, but do not choose #4 at all).]
