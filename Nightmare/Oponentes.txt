----------------------------PART I - OPPONENT LIST----------------------------
The following is a table of most of the opponents in this game. The english
names are followed in parentheses by the Japanese names. The next column is
whether or not they force you to duel in Shadow Games.  The opponents that
have both Y (yes) and N (no) change at the point in parentheses.  The third 
column are their feelings towards you after the first duel.  The fourth column
is the first point of the game at which the opponent can be dueled.  The fifth
column is the (average? I haven't tested this fully yet.) amount of duels it
takes to register the duelist in your duel disk.  The final column is the
minimum amount of duels it takes for each opponent to be interested in trading
cards.  Characters begin to randomly ask for trades once their status is at
least at neutral. (:|) I think getting the yellow XD status prevents them from
unregistering you, but I'm not sure.

*WARNING: There may be a bug in this game that prevents Pegasus from appearing
after you beat Yami Marik. It is imperative that you get Imperial Order from
him as a trade before then, or you may miss your chance to get it.
